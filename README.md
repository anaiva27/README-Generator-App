## Description  
The application dynamically generates a professional README file, that is usually used to describe projects, applications and more, and explains how to use them, along with installation instructions and contributing guidelines. The app works as a template, that user will fill up by answering certain questions inside the command line in Node.
<br><br> 

## Installation
To run this application, the user will need to install `Inquirer.js`, which is a command line interface for Node.js that initiates the process of asking questions, providing error feedback, validating answers and other query-based tasks.
Also the user is going to need `package.json` that will hold various metadata relevant to the project. This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as how to handle the project's dependencies.
To install all dependancies use command: 
```
npm i
``` 
<br>

## Usage 

The user can easily invoke this application by opening the index.js file Node.js and typing `node index.js`. Then the user will be prompted with a series of questions about the project details and some personal information inside the command line. After the questions have been answered, the user will get a confirmation message `"The file has been successfully generated"`. The file will be located in the root directory and will be name `sampleREADME.md`.
